NAME

grid-proxy-info - Display information about a proxy certificate

[[grid-proxy-info-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*grid-proxy-info* -help | -usage | -version

*grid-proxy-info* -e | -exists [-valid 'HOURS:MINUTES' | -v 'HOURS:MINUTES'] [-hours 'HOURS' | -h 'HOURS'] [-bits 'BITS' | -b 'BITS']

*grid-proxy-info* [OPTIONS]

[[grid-proxy-info-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *grid-proxy-info* program extracts information from an X.509 proxy
certificates, and optionally displays or returns an exit code based on that
information.

The default mode of operation is to print the following facts about the current
user's default proxy: subject, issuer, identity, type, strength, path, and time
left.  If the command-line option '-exists' or
'-e' is included in the command-line, nothing is printed unless
one of the print options is specified. Instead, *grid-proxy-info* determines if
a valid proxy exists and, if so, exits with the exit code `0`;
if a proxy does not exist or is not valid, *grid-proxy-info* exits with the
exit code `1`.  Additional validity criteria can be added
by using the '-valid', '-v', '-hours', '-h', '-bits', or '-b' command-line
options. If used, these options must occur *after* the '-e' or
'-exists' command-line options. Those options are only valid
if one of the '-e' or '-exists' command-line
options is used.

[[grid-proxy-info-OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
-------
The complete set of command-line options to *grid-proxy-info* are:

*-help, -usage*::
    Display the command-line options to *grid-proxy-info*.
*-version*::
    Display the version number of the *grid-proxy-info* command.
*-debug*::
    Display verbose error messages.
*-file 'PROXYFILE', -f 'PROXYFILE'*::
    Read the proxy located in the file 'PROXYFILE' instead of using the default
    proxy.
*-subject, -s*::
    Display the proxy certificate's subject distinguished name.
*-issuer, -i*::
    Display the proxy certificate issuer's distinguished name.
*-identity*::
    Display the proxy certificate's identity.  For non-independent proxies, the
    identity is the subject of the certificate which issued the first proxy in
    the proxy chain.
*-type*::
    Display the type of proxy certificate. The type string includes the format
    ("legacy", "draft", or RFC 3280 compliant), identity type ("impersonation"
    or "independent"), and policy ("limited" or "full"). See
    *grid-proxy-init(1)* for information about how to create different types of
    proxies.
*-timeleft*::
    Display the number of seconds remaining until the proxy certificate
    expires.
*-strength*::
    Display the strength (in bits) of the key associated with the proxy
    certificate.
*-all*::
    Display the default information for the proxy when also using the
    '-e' or '-exists' command-line option.
*-text*::
    Display the proxy certificate contents to standard output, including policy
    information, issuer, public key, and modulus.
*-path*::
    Display the path to the file containing the default proxy certificate.
*-rfc2253*::
    Display distinguished names for the subject, issuer, and identity using the
    string representation described in RFC 2253, instead of the legacy
    format.
*-exists, -e*::
    Perform an existence and validity check for the proxy. If a valid proxy
    exists and matches the criteria described by other command-line options (if
    any), exit with 0; otherwise, exit with 1. This option must be before other
    validity check predicate in the command-line options. If this option is
    specified, the output of the default facts about the proxy is disabled. Use
    the '-all' option to have the information displayed as well as the exit
    code set.
*-valid 'HOURS:MINUTES', -v 'HOURS:MINUTES', -hours 'HOURS', -h 'HOURS'*::
    Check that the proxy certificate is valid for at least 'HOURS' hours and
    'MINUTES' minutes. If it is not, *grid-proxy-info* will exit with exit code
    `1`.
*-bits 'BITS', -b 'BITS'*::
    Check that the proxy certificate key strength is at least 'BITS'
    bits.

[[grid-proxy-info-ENVIRONMENT]]
ENVIRONMENT
-----------
The following environment variables affect the execution of *grid-proxy-info*:

*X509_USER_PROXY*::
    Path to the default user proxy.
