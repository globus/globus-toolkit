MyProxy Delegation Service in Python
------------------------------------

The MyProxy Delegation Service is a Python implementation of MyProxy OAuth
protocol, https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=10SC7oSURc-EgxMQjcCS50gz0u2HzDJAFiG5hEHiSdxA.
The service can be deployed to
Apache with mod\_wsgi or run as a standalone service using the python wsgiref
server. An example configuration file for Apache is in conf/.
The file should be copied to /etc/apache2/conf.d/ on Debian-based systems, or
to /etc/httpd/conf.d/ on Red Hat-based system.

By default, the service uses SQLite3 database. A path to the database file is
hard-coded in myproxyoauth/database.py. The directory with the database file
must be readable and writable by the user the wsgi process runs as.

To generate web pages, the service uses templates stored in
myproxyoauth/templates/. The templates, and other static files stored in
myproxyoauth/static/ like images or cascade style sheets can be easily edited
and displayed directly in a web browser. The templates are accessible at
https://hostname/oauth/templates/, and the static files at
https://hostname/oauth/static/.

To use the service with Globus Online, Globus Online, that acts here as an OAuth
client, has to be registered with the service first. To trigger the registration
workflow, run `myproxy-oauth-setup` from the server cli. The Globus Online user
specified in setup will become an admin of the service.

Prerequisite packages on Debian-based systems:

* python >= 2.5
* python-crypto >= 2.0 and python-m2crypto or python-crypto >= 2.2
* python-openssl

If you want to use this with apache2 instead of the standalone server, you'll
also need libapache2-mod-wsgi and the apache2 server with the ssl module
enabled and the default-ssl site enabled.

Prerequisite packages on RedHat-based systems
* pyOpenSSL
* python-crypto

If you want to use this with apache2 instead of the standalone service, you'll
also need httpd, mod\_wsgi, and mod\_ssl
