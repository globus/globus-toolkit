#
#  We should really do something smart here instead of just hard coding
#  the version number. However, as it can not be determined by just looking
#  at the set of packages installed, nor be determined at build time,
#  we are stuck with this solution for a while. See 
#  http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=1723 for more
#  information about this.
