/*  globus_args.h : a Globus-style argument option parser

    The API implements the following behavior:

    (1) Valid flags are detected as one '-' followed by any character that is
        not '-'.

    (2) A flag may have zero or more predicates (values) associated with it,
        but for any given flag the number of those (the arity) is fixed.

    (3) If a flag has arity of k>0, then the k arguments following the flag
        are taken verbatim as the predicates associated with the flag,
	including leading '-', if any.

    (4) Flagged arguments must not be combined (i.e., "-fg" is never the same
        as "-f -g".

    (5) The end of flagged arguments will be detected either implicitly (with
        the first unrecognized or non-flagged argument) or explicitly (when
	"--" is detected when scanning for the next argument flag).

    (6) When scanning for the next argument flag, an error is detected if the
        detected argument begins with "--*", where '*' is any character.

    (7) The argument flags "-help", "-usage", "-version", and "-versions" are 
        reserved, and if they are detected the library will create an 
        appropriate message and signal an error.

    (8) If an error is detected, then the library will create an error message.

    (9) A created error message will be written to stderr, unless dictated
        otherwise by the user (in which case the error message will be passed
	back to the user).

/*  option specification datatype

    An option can have several names: "-foo" or "-f" for short, etc.
    The parsing library therefore identifies an option trough its
    id_number. The user must ensure that the id_number is unique for
    each descriptor_t.

    The arity of an option is defined as its number of predicates
    (following arguments): "-debug" has arity 0, "-foo xyz 123"
    has arity 2, etc.

    The array of predicate test functions, "tests", may be or contain
    GLOBUS_NULL. Any non-null entry in the tests array must have a
    non-null entry in the "test_parms" array.

/*  globus_args_scan() -- the parsing function 

    This function scans the argument list 'argv', validates the
    arguments as appropriate, and builds an ordered list with the
    successfully validated argument options.
    
    An option is successfully validated if it is found in the
    'options' array, and the predicate values associated with it
    passes the predicate test functions associated with the same
    option.

    If 'error_msg' is null, messages will be written to
    stderr. Otherwise, it will be pointed to an allocated buffer which
    must be freed by the user, containing the error message.

    A 'reserved option' is one of the 0-arity options "-help",
    "-usage", "-version", or "-versions". When detected, a message is created
    (and written to stderr if error_msg is null), containing the
    appropriate information. A reserved option will terminate the
    argument scanning and return.

    The successfully validated options are removed from the 'argv' list
    unless an error is detected. 'argc' is updated accordingly. The
    argc/argv convention with argv[0] being the name of the executable
    is maintained.

    Returns:
    -> The number of successfully identified and validated options.
    -> -1 if an error was detected
    -> GLOBUS_ARGS_HELP or GLOBUS_ARGS_VERSION
       if the corresponding reserved option was detected
       (all < 0)
