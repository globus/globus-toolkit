.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBglobus\-job\-manager\fR program is a servivce which starts and controls GRAM jobs which are executed by a local resource management system, such as LSF or Condor\&. The \fBglobus\-job\-manager\fR program is typically started by the \fBglobus\-gatekeeper\fR program and not directly by a user\&. It runs until all jobs it is managing have terminated or its delegated credentials have expired\&.
.sp
Typically, users interact with the \fBglobus\-job\-manager\fR program via client applications such as \fBglobusrun\fR, \fBglobus\-job\-submit\fR, or tools such as CoG jglobus or Condor\-G\&.
