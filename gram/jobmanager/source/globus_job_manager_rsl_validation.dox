@page globus_gram_job_manager_rsl_validation_file RSL Validation File Format

The idea behind the RSL Validation file is to provide a mechanism for
job manager scheduler interfaces to implement RSL extensions, while having
the job manager still be able to decide whether a job request contains
a valid RSL string. In addition to indicating what RSL attributes are
valid, the RSL validation file contains information about when the RSL
attribute may be used, it's default value, and the format of the attribute's
value.

The validation file used by the job manager is located in the 
@ref validation_file_example section of the manual.

@section validation_file_format File Format

@subsection validation_comments Comments

The RSL validation file may contain comments. Comments are indicated in
the file by a line beginning with the <em>#</em> character. Comments
continue until end-of-line. Comments are discarded by the RSL Validation
File parser.

Example:

@code
# I am a comment. Ignore me.
@endcode

@subsection validation_records ValidationRecords

The RSL validition file consists of a set of <em>ValidationRecords</em>.
Each <em>ValidationRecord</em> consists of a number of
<em>ValidationProperties</em> associated with a single
RSL attribute. <em>ValidationRecord</em>s are separated by a blank line
in the RSL validation file. 

@subsection validation_properties Validation Properties

A <em>ValidationProperty</em> is defined in the RSL validation file by
a <em>PropertyName</em> and a <em>PropertyValue</em>. The syntax of a
validation property is simply the <em>PropertyName</em> followed by
a colon character, followed by a <em>PropertyValue</em>.

If a <em>PropertyValue</em> begins with a double-quote, then it may span
multiple lines. Double-quote characters within a multiline
<em>PropertyValue</em> must be escaped by a preceding backslash character.
An unquoted <em>PropertyValue</em> ends at the first newline character.

Example:

@code
Attribute: directory
Description: "Specifies the path of the directory the jobmanager will use as
              the default directory for the requested job."
@endcode

@subsection rsl_validation_record_types Defined PropertyNames

The following <em>PropertyName</em>s are understood by this
version of the RSL validation file parser. Any unknown <em>PropertyName</em>
will cause the <em>ValidationProprty</em> to be ignored by the parser.

@par Attribute
The name of the RSL parameter to which this record refers.

@par Description
A textual description of what the RSL parameter means.
 
@par Default

The default value of the RSL parameter if it is not found in the
RSL. The default value is only used if the DefaultWhen value matches
the current validation mode.

@par Values

A string containing whitespace-separated list of enumerated values
which are valid for this RSL attribute. For example, for the "dryrun"
parameter, this may be <b>"yes no"</b>.

@par RequiredWhen
Some subset of the "when strings" (@ref when_strings "see below"),
indicating when the RSL parameter is required for the RSL to be valid.

@par DefaultWhen
Some subset of the "when strings" (@ref when_strings "see below")
indicating when then RSL's default value will be used if the RSL
attribute is not present in the RSL.

@par ValidWhen

Some subset of the "when strings" (@ref when_strings "see below")
indicating when then RSL attribute may be used.

@subsection when_strings "When" Strings

The set of when strings understood by the RSL validation file parser are

@par GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_SUBMIT

The RSL attribute pertains to job submission.

@par GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_MANAGER_RESTART

The RSL attribute pertains to job manager restart.

@par GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_MANAGER_STDIO_UPDATE

The RSL attribute pertains to the STDIO_UPDATE signal.
