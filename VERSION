This is MyProxy v3.8 XX Xxx 2007.
This version should be protocol compatible with all versions since v0.2.
Binary compatibility of the C API is not guaranteed between releases.

Version History
---------------
v3.8 XX Xxx 2007
  - fix configure check for OCSP functions in OpenSSL for enabling
    OCSP support
  - for --help, --usage, and --version options, exit with status 0
    after printing help/usage/version information
  - add OpenSSL Engine support in the MyProxy CA to enable the use of
    hardware tokens via new myproxy-server.config
    certificate_openssl_engine options
  - check if client authenticates with a limited proxy, and if so,
    only allow the client to obtain another limited proxy, unless
    ignore_globus_limited_proxy_flag is set in myproxy-server.config
  - optionally store all certificates issued by the MyProxy CA in a
    directory via the certificate_out_dir myproxy-server.config option

v3.7 12 Dec 2006
  - fix handling of usernames containing '/', '-', and '.' characters;
    note this required a change to the myproxy-server repository
    format, so credential data files written by a new myproxy-server
    won't be readable by an older myproxy-server
  - verify that credentials in the myproxy-server repository are still
    valid (i.e., not revoked) before performing delegation
  - added myproxy-admin-query --invalid option for listing, locking,
    or removing invalid credentials from repository
  - optionally check OCSP status of stored credentials before
    performing delegation via myproxy-server.config ocsp settings;
    requires GT 3.2 (OpenSSL 0.9.7) or later
  - update etc.init.d.myproxy script to use pidfile to locate server
    to stop (rather than searching ps output), include a restart
    option, and exit with error if $GLOBUS_LOCATION isn't set
  - if the myproxy-server hostname given by $MYPROXY_SERVER or the -s
    option resolves to multiple IP addresses, clients will connect to
    each address until a connection is established or all fail
  - added accepted_credentials_mapapp call-out version of
    accepted_credentials_mapfile in myproxy-server.config
  - support unencrypted, although still signed, Pubcookie granting
    cookies as passwords
  - added myproxy-server.config syslog_ident option
  - improved MyProxy CA logging
  - added myproxy-server --listen to specify host/ip to bind to

v3.6 10 Aug 2006
  - support credential renewal via the MyProxy CA using
    myproxy-server.config authorized_renewers/default_renewers options
  - provide an access control list for storing credentials via the
    myproxy-server.config accepted_credentials_mapfile option
  - fix insecure temporary file handling in myproxy-admin-adduser
  - fix insecure input handling in myproxy-get-delegation.cgi example
  - support VOMS attributes in myproxy-server.config policies
  - in CA, issue certificates valid starting 5 minutes in the past to
    account for possible clock skew between hosts
  - add check_multiple_credentials option in myproxy-server.config
    to allow clients to retrieve a credential for a given username
    even if the associated "credential name" isn't provided (via
    myproxy-logon --credname)

v3.5 14 Mar 2006
  - dropped support for certificate_issuer option in
    myproxy-server.config; use certificate_issuer_cert instead
  - added myproxy_accept_delegation_ex() to retrieve credentials to a
    buffer rather than a file
  - in myproxy-logon, added support for writing credential to standard
    output via '-o -' option; also added --quiet option
  - added myproxy-logon --no_credentials option to authenticate
    without retrieving credentials
  - added certificate_mapapp call-out for mapping usernames to
    certificate subject distinguished names for the CA module
  - added certificate_extfile and certificate_extapp (call-out) for
    setting extensions in certificates issued by CA module
  - do not indicate in info command error output whether credentials
    owned by someone else exist, to avoid giving potentially useful
    information to an attacker
  - delegate credentials with minimum lifetime of 5 minutes to avoid
    problems with clock skew
  - fixed build problem with GT 2.4/3.0 introduced in v3.4:
    EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup() wasn't in OpenSSL 0.9.6

v3.4 19 Dec 2005
  - added myproxy-test -valgrind option for detecting memory errors

  - add support for CA username to DN resolution via LDAP using
    myproxy-server.config ca_ldap options
  - add myproxy-server authentication support for Pubcookie
    (http://www.pubcookie.org/) granting cookie via
    pubcookie_granting_cert and pubcookie_app_server_key

    always applied even if the credential had a key retriever policy
  - fixed myproxy-test GT 2.4 compatibility problem in v0.6.5
  - fixed myproxy_get_delegation() signature, erroneously changed in
    v0.6.2, to maintain API-level compatibility
  - added dynamic buffer management for improved handling of large
    messages

v0.6.5 8 Apr 2005 (GPT package version 1.17)
  - added support for RFC 3820 proxy certificate format
  - renamed myproxy-get-delegation to myproxy-logon;
    kept myproxy-get-delegation symlink for backward compatibility
  - added myproxy-store and myproxy-retrieve commands for storing and

  - improve error messages for too-short passphrases (6 character minimum)

v0.6.4 4 Jan 2005 (GPT package version 1.16)
  - fixed file permission bug in myproxy-admin-load-credential

v0.6.3 22 Nov 2004 (GPT package version 1.15)
  - updated GPT packaging for compatibility with GT 3.9.3
    (globus_gssapi_gsi-4.0)
  - added support for $GT_PROXY_MODE="old" in myproxy-get-delegation,
    to retrieve a "legacy globus proxy" from an end-entity certificate
    stored in the MyProxy repository.
  - modified client tools to attempt connecting to the server first,
    before prompting for user input, to catch server problems early.
  - added initial experimental support for Kerberos authentication via
    the SASL/GSSAPI mechanism.
  - removed dependency on perl Expect package in myproxy-test
  - added myproxy-test -startserver option
  - added myproxy-server --pidfile option to ease myproxy-server
    shutdown

v0.6.2 21 Jun 2004 (GPT package version 1.14)
  - added initial experimental support for PAM authentication via
    the SASL/PLAIN mechanism.
  - changed myproxy-admin-change-pass so an empty pass phrase
    can be used for unencrypted keys (for example, for renewal keys)
  - fixed myproxy-admin-adduser to not depend on nonexistent
    myproxy-admin-adduser-config command
  - removed pass phrase functions from myproxy-admin-load-credential,
    so the existing pass phrase on the source key is kept as is.
    Use myproxy-admin-change-pass to change the pass phrase of a
    credential after loading.
  - fixed GT 2.2 and Java CoG incompatibility introduced in v0.6.1.
    Note: if repository contains end-entity credentials, Java CoG
    will retrieve old-style (legacy) proxies because the Java CoG
    certificate request doesn't specify the proxy type.
  - changed signature of myproxy_get_delegation() method.
    original signature is restored in v2.0.

v0.6.1 30 Mar 2004 (GPT package version 1.13)
  Fixed a bug where the myproxy-server would always delegate new-style
  proxy credentials from end-entity credentials in repository.  The
  myproxy-server now respects proxy type in the certificate request
  when end-entity credentials are stored in repository.  However, if
  the repository contains proxy credentials, the server will delegate
  a proxy of the same type as stored in the repository irrespective of
  the certificate request, because new-style and old-style proxies
  can't be mixed.  This bug fix resulted in an incompatibility with GT
  2.2 and Java CoG clients, fixed in v0.6.2.

v0.6.0 22 Mar 2004 (GPT package version 1.12)
  - added max_proxy_lifetime server configuration option for limiting
    the lifetime of retrieved credentials

  - changed myproxy-get-delegation -d option to have effect even when
    -a option is not given
  - added support for OpenSSL 0.9.7

  - fixed networking problem with v0.5.7 on some platforms

v0.5.7 25 Aug 2003 (GPT package version 1.9)
  - fixed additional problems with handling large credentials
  - bugfix: myproxy-admin-load-credential fails to prompt for
    passphrase of source credential in versions 0.5.4-0.5.6.

v0.5.6 31 Jul 2003 (GPT package version 1.8)
  - added support for Globus Toolkit 3.0 libraries
  - added support for new GSI proxy certificate format
  - fixed 'myproxy-info -d'

  This version fixes a build problem on AIX.

v0.5.2 10 Mar 2003 (GPT package version 1.4)
  This version adds the myproxy-admin-query and
  myproxy-admin-load-credential commands and adds support for running
  the myproxy-server with a /CN=myproxy/fqhn credential.

v0.5.1 12 Feb 2003 (GPT package version 1.3)
  This release fixes a bug where the X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY
  environment variables would confuse myproxy-init.

v0.5.0 15 Nov 2002 (GPT package version 1.2)
  This is the first version for Globus Toolkit 2.2.  It adds support
  for storing multiple credentials per username, stores private keys
  encrypted with the credential's passphrase (if set), and adds the
  myproxy-change-pass-phrase command.  It is also the first version to
  be released unter the NCSA Open Source license.  Note that due to
  version incompatibilities with Globus Toolkit 2.2 libraries and the
  Java CoG (not specific to MyProxy), this and future versions of
  MyProxy are not compatible with Java CoG versions before 1.0.

v0.4.6 3 Sep 2002 (GPT package version 1.1)
  This version adds sample init.d and xinetd entries in the GPT
  package.

  using myproxy-init.

v0.4.2 4 Feb 2002
  This version includes the GSI distinguished name matching logic that
  was removed in v0.4.0, so for example host/fqhn will now match fqhn
  again.  It also adds support for restricting the TCP port ranges of
  the clients.

v0.4.1 4 Dec 2001
  This version adds support for Globus 2.0 and optionally using the
  distinguished name from the proxy certificate as the default myproxy
  username.

v0.4.0 20 Nov 2001
  This version adds support for anonymous X.509 client authentication,
  to allow users to retrieve a credential using their myproxy
  passphrase when they don't already have a credential.  The myproxy
  server configuration file can enable or disable anonymous and
  certificate-based (from v0.3) authentication.

v0.3 5 Oct 2001
  This version adds support for certificate-based authentication in
  addition to passphrase based authentication, to enable credential
  renewal.  It was developed by Daniel Kouril and Miroslav Ruda for
  the European DataGrid project.
