v0.4.4 22 Mar 2002

  using myproxy-init.

v0.4.2 4 Feb 2002
  This version includes the GSI distinguished name matching logic that

  again.  It also adds support for restricting the TCP port ranges of
  the clients.

v0.4.1 4 Dec 2001
  This version adds support for Globus 2.0 and optionally using the
  distinguished name from the proxy certificate as the default myproxy
  username.

v0.4.0 20 Nov 2001
  This version adds support for anonymous X.509 client authentication,
  to allow users to retrieve a credential using their myproxy
  passphrase when they don't already have a credential.  The myproxy
  server configuration file can enable or disable anonymous and
  certificate-based (from v0.3) authentication.

v0.3 5 Oct 2001
  This version adds support for certificate-based authentication in
  addition to passphrase based authentication, to enable credential
  renewal.  It was developed by Daniel Kouril and Miroslav Ruda for
  the European DataGrid project.
