IMPORTANT NOTICE

Beginning with version 2.6.0, the WU-FTPD Development Group is moving the build
process to use GNU Autoconf.  Until this move is completed, both build systems
will remain supported.  You are encouraged to use the new 'configure' command
to select options, then 'make' to compile the daemon. See the file
README.AUTOCONF for details.
If problems occur, please report them to the development group via email to
wuftpd-members@wu-ftpd.org  We are soliciting feedback on the new configuration
process, and your help is greatly appreciated.

If you choose to continue to use the process described below, bear in mind it
will be phased out over then next few releases: when he are reasonably sure the
new configuration system works for most target platforms.



INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS as of $Date$

1a. Type "./build xxx" in the root of the source tree. Note that you can
    specify an alternate C compiler by entering "./build CC=yyy xxx" where
    yyy is the command that would replace "cc" to start the alternate compiler.
    [For "gcc", the command sould be "./build CC=gcc xxx".]

  In the build command line, xxx may be one of the following:
  gen    : generic make (copy this when porting to a new system)
  aix    : IBM AIX
  aux    : AU/X
  bdi    : BSD/OS
  bsd    : BSD
  dec    : DEC Unix 3.X
  du4    : DEC Unix 4.X or later
  dyn    : Dynix
  fbs    : FreeBSD 2.0 or later
  hiu    : Hitachi Unix
  hpx    : HP-UX
  lnx    : Linux (tested on 2.0.30)
  nbs    : NetBSD 1.X
  nx2    : NeXTstep 2.x
  nx3    : NeXTstep 3.x
  osf    : OSF/1
  osx    : Mac OS X
  ptx    : ???
  sco    : SCO Unix 3.2v4.2/SCO OpenServer 5
  sgi    : SGI Irix 4.0.5a
  sny    : Sony NewsOS
  sol    : SunOS 5.x / Solaris 2.x 
  s41    : SunOS 4.1.x 
  ult    : Ultrix 4.x
  uxw    : UnixWare 1.1 or later
  clean  : Clean up object files and such to reduce disk space after building.
  install: Install ftpd

1b. If your system is not defined above...
        cp src/config/config.gen src/config/config.xxx
        cp src/makefiles/Makefile.gen src/makefiles/Makefile.xxx
        cp support/makefiles/Makefile.gen support/makefiles/Makefile.xxx

    Edit the three files appropriately.  Go back to step 1a. This is not
    trivial. You may want to join the mailing list and ask for help.

    [Be sure to send those changes to wuftpd-questions@wu-ftpd.org]

2. If you are upgrading to a new version of wu-ftpd, you should save copies
   of all your old configuration files. If you don't, they will be replaced
   by new sample ones from this distribution when you do the installation 
   step.

    If you're going to use the samples as a base (most people do, at least
    initially) be sure to edit them to fit your site.

3.  Type "./build install" as the super-user. 

4.  Edit the "/etc/inetd.conf" file to point to the new ftpd. In most cases,
    this step will not be necessary as the install step should have placed
    the new softare in the same location as the old version. If you intend
    to actually make use of the extended features of this server, you will
    need to insure that the server is started with the "-a" option. Usually,
    this means that you will need to add a "-a" (without the quotes) to the
    end of the line in /etc/inetd.conf that starts the server. For operating
    systems that don't use /etc/inetd.conf, you will need to read your OS
    documentation to find out how to do this. By default, the server acts
    like a regular ftp server (one without enhancements).

5.  On BSD-like sytems, type "kill -1 `ps t"?" | grep inetd`"
    On SGI systems, type "/etc/killall -HUP inetd"
    On AIX systems, type "refresh -s inetd"	

6.  For the server to support creation of .tar.Z files of directories, you
    need GNU tar installed [remember to put a copy in the anonymous ftp
    hierarchy].  If you need a copy, it is available from the host
    prep.ai.mit.edu in the /pub/gnu directory.

7.  Copy the compress program to ~ftp/bin/compress. Copy the ls program to
    ~ftp/bin/ls. If your operating system uses shared libraries and these
    programs are not statically linked, you will need to duplicate the 
    relevant shared libaries in the correct place. 

8.  Use the ckconfig program created when you did the first step to find out
    where to put the various configuration files for ftpd: ftpconversions, 
    ftpusers, and ftpgroups. There are examples of these files in the 
    doc/examples directory. ckconfig is in the bin directory. Be sure to 
    fix any other problems ckconfig reports

9.  Put any executables that you want anonymous users to be able to run in
     _SITE_EXEC.  Be careful what you put here.

10. Rerun bin/ckconfig to make sure that all the support files are
    properly installed.
