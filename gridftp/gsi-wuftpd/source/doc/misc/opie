* What is OPIE:

  "One-time Passwords In Everything" (OPIE) is a freely distributable
software package originally developed at and for the US Naval Research
Laboratory (NRL). Recent versions are the result of a cooperative effort
between of NRL, several of the original NRL authors, The Inner Net, and
many other contributors from the Internet community.

  OPIE is an implementation of the One-Time Password (OTP) System that is
being considered for the Internet standards-track. OPIE provides a one-time
password system. The system should be secure against the passive attacks
now commonplace on the Internet (see RFC 1704 for more details). The system
is vulnerable to active dictionary attacks, though these are not widespread
at present and can be detected through proper use of system audit software.


* wu-ftpd and OPIE:

Wu-ftpd uses the opieaccess mechanism, which enables to choose the
authentification method. Depending on the /etc/opieaccess file, you can use
either standard password login or opie login. So an opie ftpd can be used
as a normal ftpd if you have an opieaccess file which enables everybody to
log in with standard password.

First and foremost, make sure you have the latest version of OPIE. The
latest version is available by anonymous FTP at:

        ftp://ftp.nrl.navy.mil/pub/security/opie
                and
        ftp://ftp.inner.net/pub/opie

READ THE DOCUMENTATION, and build libopie.a

Then edit config.h, and change the line #undef OPIE to #define OPIE.
