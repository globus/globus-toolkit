This is the current list of things outstanding for the 4.0 release.
** denotes must happen before feature freeze
XX denotes unlikely that this will be in 4.0

protocol:
-- correct FEAT response?
-- reply codes - verify.
-- verify that dsi api is correct wrt to errors
-- error out usefully to server and client when cred problem in gssapi driver

signal handling:
-- SIGINT needs to handle data-node shutdown

striping:
-- verify eofc handling, should move out of remote into data.c
-- verify _get_read_range()
-- consolidate some restart ranges instead of sending one from every stripe

ipc:
XX connect backwards!! 0

logging:
-- instrument code
-- verify output format
-- specify log format by configuration
-- syslog module for globus_logging

general:
-- instrument any remaining configuration options and limits

threads:
-- quick test that stuff works -- not really looking for 100% right now
-- walk through locks

cleanup:
-- verify test suite
-- clean majority of memory leaks

**Usability issues:
DOC DOC DOC
only load one config file, first found
be chatty while parsing config
change option names to better group together common options
syslog module
ipc security options - doc well, make sure it works the way we expect
    access lists for front/backend connections? 
need some spec compliant support for partitioned layout
    current stripeblocksize impl is basically spec compliant RR

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
known bugs:
-- ipc local mode doesn't work (besides no way to initiate it)
-- not calling _finish() in data.c for some request funcs that fail before
    the dsi call. 
-- in server_lib globus_gsc_959_finished_command chain the message gets freed
    in instances that it should not be, everyone that calls into it frees their
    own messages.
-- "pasv/port followed by retr/stor /invalidpath (fails) retr/stor /anything"
    causes an assertion... i think data.c is destroying the data chan on the
    transfer_finished error, but maybe not sending disconnected? (either way, 
    data chan should be fine on transfer errors, just not data chan errors).
-- error out of option parsing properly
-- ipc failure while the handle is owned by the dsi destroys the handle. should
    not free until user calls release or close, and just error out of any other
    calls that attempt to use the handle.
