This is the current list of things outstanding for the 4.0 release.

protocol:
-- verify FEAT response
-- reply codes - verify.
-- notify server of error when cred problem in gssapi_ftp driver

striping:
-- verify eofc handling, see if we can move out of dsi into data.c
-- optimize _get_read_range()
-- consolidate some restart ranges instead of sending one from every stripe
-- need some spec compliant support for partitioned layout
    current stripeblocksize impl is basically spec compliant RR
    
logging:
-- instrument code
-- clean up transfer and usage logging

other:
-- error out of option parsing properly
-- send a connection denied message to connections we don't want to accept, 
    rather than ignoring the accept.
-- int->void*->int casting over ipc... better way?

cleanup:
-- format -help screen
-- verify test suite
-- find leaks in error cases
-- DOC
-- remove hpss modules

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
known issues:
-- errors in some control.c requests will hang -- need to finish() there
-- ipc failure while the handle is owned by the dsi destroys the handle. should
    not free until user calls release or close, and just error out of any other
    calls that attempt to use the handle. (verify fixed?)
-- passing size_t's over ipc as ints... will be a problem on 64 bit systems 
    where int isn't big enough.  not likely to be a problem in practice
    since the args we store in size_t (buffer sizes, etc) should never be
    too large for an int...
-- problem with preauth timeout    
-- there may be an issue with group permissions -- not sure if it results
    in any problems.
-- closing connections reports an xio error when the connection was closed
    normally.  possibly an xio/cancel problem.
-- ipc connections with security enabled (default) aren't being cached
    correctly, results in IPC ERRORs as the client closes.
-- detach check is before config file is read, so detach in config file
    doesn't work.  also possible other issues with config checks at 
    fork/exec time when using only config file.
-- server exec name discovery fails when there is not a valid $GL. -exec
    flag works around this, but not ideal.





future:
-- alternate ipc connection modes
-- ipc local mode
-- specify log format by configuration
