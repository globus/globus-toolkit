file not trunc on striped puts, since they all look like partials, also
    truncating on pasv stor... who truncates, and have to deal with
    data coming before the 150 response

make get_range work for striping (write range_list_remove)
***range_lists don't know that -1 is max length?***

fix up error in data.c and dsi, or make use result_t over ipc temporarily

make data_destroy go

make abort go

clean up memory and locking in data.c

clean up rest of stuff from pre-dsi change (old attrs that just copy to new
    info structs, etc)

add striping stuff to feat list

think if broadcast would be quick enough, and do correct connection 
    count stuff if not (for eofs)

add symlink_target to stat buffer, server-lib stuff to display it in mlsx

add security to ipc

implement security stuff in dsi (mainly sending and using delegated cred)

update doc to reflect striping info and current issues/limitations

check if threaded works (and fix if easy) so we can at least list it as a known issue

verify test suite on following instances:
    single local non-daemon, daemon, detached and inetd
    single remote and data-node non-daemon, daemon, detached and inetd 
    4 stripe remote in same modes (general success here, not expected to pass everything)
                 
check what version this should be, and change package name 

merge branch to trunk and verify nothing broke




**OLD ALPHA STUFF:

MUST HAVE
--------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER:
-instrument logging in server
-implement abort_cb on server side
-verify data destroy working on server end (and no leaks!)
-call control_disconnected() when needed
-server mem management... i know there are some leaks with attrs and now with instance for event stuff
-mimic wu cmdline opt names when applicable i.e. -S -p etc etc (important now so people don't start using opts that we will drop)
-verify inetd is prepped right

LIB:
-verify feat list

BOTH:
-add proper return vals/messages for error situations
-verify reply codes
-recheck exit/quit/abort states (after server abort/exit stuff is good)

--------------------------------------------------------------

OTHER: (non-code)
update gridftp-server-stable-branch tag




if time, desire, etc etc:
--------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER:
-make forking/daemon mode better (maybe leave this out for now)
-define logging classes in config
-produce netlogger output (based on event timer i guess?... -Z option in wu)
-global config opts can be non-overridable, or forced to a range
-think about config val checking/verification
-sync(2) before each transfer stat update (by option only, unless it doesn't affect perf)
-make sure server will work with tcpd

LIB:
-additional functionality for STAT (959 says transfer stats and other shit)
-additional command to get server version

--------------------------------------------------------------
