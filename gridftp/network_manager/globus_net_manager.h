/**
 * @mainpage Overview
 * The Globus Net Manager library is a plug-in point for network
 * management tasks, such as:
 * - selectively open ports in a firewall and allow these ports to be closed
 *   when transfers are complete
 * - configure a virtual circuit based on a site policy and route traffic
 *   over this circuit
 * - route network traffic related to a task over a particular network
 *
 * @section globus_net_manager_implementor Implementing a Network Manager
 * For users interested in implementing such functionality, 
 * the @link globus_net_manager globus_net_manager library @endlink provides a
 * low-level set of interfaces to implement specific network managers.
 *
 * These interfaces provide methods for registering functions to be called
 * before and after interesting network operations. Those functions may
 * observe or modify the attributes of the network operations. This information
 * can be used to modify the port to listen on, or modify the 
 * addresses used to use a particular network interface.
 *
 * In addition, the globus_net_manager library includes sample
 * implementations to provide a starting point for implementing
 * network managers.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Logging Manager</dt>
 * <dd>Logs network operations as they occur. This implementation
 * shows the simplest network manager implementation in C</dd>
 * <!--<dt>Exec Manager</dt>
 * <dd>Launches a command when network operations occur. This implementation
 * enables network managers to be implemented in any external process.</dd>-->
 * <dt>@ref globus_net_manager_python<dt>
 * <dd>Loads a python module, and calls python functions when network
 * operations occur.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * The Logging Manager sample is broken down in detail in the
 * @ref globus_net_manager_tutorial page.
 *
 * @section globus_net_manager_user Using Network Managers
 * For users interested in using the network manager in their own services,
 * they can use the @ref globus_net_manager_context APIs to configure and
 * invoke network manager plug-ins, or the
 * @link globus_xio_net_manager_driver Globus XIO Net Manager Driver @endlink
 * to plug the network manager interface directly into the Globus XIO stack.

 * @details
 * The Globus Net Manager uses Globus Toolkit module activation and
 * deactivation. Before any Net Manager functions can be called,
 * the module must be activated, like this:
 * @code
       globus_module_activate(GLOBUS_NET_MANAGER_MODULE);
   @endcode
 *
 * This function returns GLOBUS_SUCCESS if the library
 * is successfully initialized.  Otherwise, an error code is returned,
 * and Net Manager functions should not be subsequently called.  
 *
 * Activations are reference counted, so it is safe to activate the
 * module multiple times or in different modules.
 *
 * To deactivate Net Manager, call
 * 
 * @code
     globus_module_deactivate(GLOBUS_NET_MANAGER_MODULE);
  @endcode
 *
 * This function should be done once for each time the Net Manager
 * was activated.
