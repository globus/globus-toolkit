/**
 * The JobStateMonitor (JSM) is a scheduler-indpendent object which provides
 * notifications of job state changes to the Managed Job Service (MJS).
 *
 * <p>
 * It provides an interface between the process monitoring of the Scheduler
 * Event Generator (SEG) and the Managed Job Resources which contain the
 * state of a job created by the ManagedJobService (MJS).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The JSM contains a registry mapping scheduler-specific job identifiers to
 * Object keys which the MJS can use to map job state changes to particular
 * job resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The JSM also contains a soft-state cache of SEG events which aren't
 * yet associated with MJR keys in its registry. Events in this cache are
 * replayed if and when the MJS creates an association between a local Job
 * ID and an Object key. Events which aren't used for some
 * interval are automatically discarded by the JSM.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The JSM also provides a persistent state callback to periodically update
 * the persistent state information. If this information is passed back to
 * the start() method of the JSM, it will be able to resume processing
 * from where its last event and not lose any events. Some events may be
 * repeated when restarts are done, and the user of this class must be
 * prepared to handle that.
 * </p>
