Required software
    * JDK 1.4.2+
    * Ant 1.5+ (do not use the ant in Fedora Core 2)
    * C compiler. If gcc, avoid version 3.2.  3.2.1 and 2.95.x are okay.
    * GNU tar
    * JDBC compliant database. For instance, postgres 7.1+

Optional software:
    * IODBC (for RLS.  For instance, version 3.0.5)
    * Tomcat (for WSRF container)
    * junit (for java unit tests)

Overview:
========
    1.  Installing GT3.9.4 (defaults)
    2.  Installing optional bundles
    3.  Installing only a subset of GT3.9.4
    4.  Platform-specific notes


1. Installing GT 3.9.4 (defaults)
=================================
First, download the required software.  Be aware that apache ant
will use the java referred to by JAVA_HOME, not necessarily the first
java executable on your PATH.  Be sure to set JAVA_HOME to the
top-level directory of your java installation before installing.

If you want to build RLS, install IODBC.  If you do not, the build of
RLS will be skipped.  See "Optional Bundles" for more details about
installing RLS.

Create a user named "globus". As the globus user, run

globus$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
globus$ make

If you do not specify a prefix, it will try to install into
/usr/local/globus-3.9.4  The build will only be successful if
the globus user has write access to the target directory.

Then see http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.4/
for setup details.


2. Installing optional bundles
==============================
If you are installing on a machine or cluster that has schedulers
installed, you can add scheduler packages by adding the following
option to your configure line:
--enable-wsgram-condor        For Condor
--enable-wsgram-lsf           For LSF
--enable-wsgram-pbs           For PBS

If you installed IODBC for RLS, add the following two items:
--enable-rls --with-iodbc-path=/path/to/iodbc

If you want to enable internationalization, say:
--enable-i18n

You can see configure --help for the full list of available options.


3. Installing only a subset of GT3.9.4
======================================
You do not have to build every subcomponent of this release.  The
makefile specifies subtargets for different functional subpieces.
See the component map at
http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/GT4Facts/index.html
for more details.

Makefile targets:
-----------------
i18n              Internationalization libraries
prewsgram         Pre-webservices GRAM
prewsgridftp      GridFTP
prewsmds          OpenLDAP-based MDS2
wsjava            Webservices java core
wsc               Webservices C core
wsmds             Webservices MDS4
wsdel             Webservices Delegation Service
wsrft             Webservices Reliable File Transfer service
wsgram            Webservices GRAM
wscas             Webservices CAS
wstests           Tests for webservices components
prews-test        Tests for pre-webservices components
rls               Replica Location Service

Note that all of these targets require the "postinstall" target also.
So, for instance, to build GridFTP alone, you would run:

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
$ make gridftp postinstall


4. Platform notes
=================
The latest platform notes are at:
http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/4.0-drafts/admin/platforms.html

    * Apple MacOS X
    * Debian
    * Fedora Core
    * HP/UX
    * IBM AIX
    * Red Hat
    * Sun Solaris
    * SuSE Linux

Apple MacOS X
-------------
Use gcc32dbg or gcc32 as flavor

Debian
------

Some kernel/libc combinations trigger a threading problem. See
bug #2194. The workaround is to set LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 in your
environment.  

Fedora Core
-----------
Fedora Core 2/3 ships with a broken ant. Install your own ant from
http://ant.apache.org and either remove the ant RPM or edit /etc/ant.conf,
setting ANT_HOME to your own ant installation.

HP/UX
-----
GPT's MD5.xs needs to be patched at line 52 with 
./gpt-3.2autotools2004/support/Digest-MD5-2.20/MD5.xs:
+ #define na PL_na
+ #define dowarn PL_dowarn

Specify --with-flavor=vendorcc32 on the configure line.  GNU tar
and GNU make are required on the PATH.

Tested on a PA-RISC box with HPUX 11.11 with IPv6 patches.

    * HP/UX ansiC
    * Java 1.4.2_06
    * Apache Ant 1.6.2

IBM AIX
-------
Supported flavors are vendorcc32dbg/vendorcc32 and
vendorcc64dbg/vendorcc64 using the Visual Age compilers (xlc). No gcc
flavors are supported.

It seems like some GPT patch-n-build packages are not able to pick up the
complete 64 bit environment. If that happens, try setting OBJECT_MODE=64
in your environment. This has to be done after GPT is built.

GNU tar is required before IBM tar in the PATH.

The toolkit has been tested on AIX 5.2 with:

    * Visual Age C/C++ 6.0
    * 32 bit version of IBM Java 1.4
    * Apache Ant 1.5.4

Red Hat
-------
No issues.

Sun Solaris
-----------
Supported flavors are gcc32, gcc64, vendorcc32 and vendorcc64. The dbg
flavors should work as well. For gcc64, a gcc built to target 64 bit
object files is required.

GPT has problems with the Sun provided perl and tar:
http://www.gridpackagingtools.org/book/latest-stable/ch01s07.html

The toolkit has been tested on Solaris 9 with:

    * Sun Workshop 6 update 2 C 5.3
    * gcc 3.4.3
    * Sun Java 1.4.2_02
    * Apache Ant 1.5.4

SuSE Linux
----------
No issues.
