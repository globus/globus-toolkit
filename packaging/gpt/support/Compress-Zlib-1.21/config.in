# 1. Do you want to build zlib as well?
#
#    If not, set the #BUILD_ZLIB variable to False.
#
#    If you want to build the zlib library along with Compress::Zlib, first
#    fetch a copy of the zlib source distribution. The address ig given
#    in the README file. Unpack the zlib source distribution into the
#    Compress::Zlib source directory. If you have fetched zlib 1.1.3, it will
#    create a directory called zlib-1.1.3. 
#    Set the BUILD_ZLIB variable below to True. 

#BUILD_ZLIB	= False
BUILD_ZLIB	= True

# 2. Where are the files zlib.h and zconf.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where zlib.h 
#    and zconf.h are installed on your system. 
#    If you have set BUILD_ZLIB above to True, the path should point to the
#    zlib source directory. A relative path is sufficient.

INCLUDE = zlib-1.1.4

# 3. Where is libz?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libz is
#    installed on your system.
#    If you have set BUILD_ZLIB above to True, the path should point to the
#    zlib source directory. A relative path is sufficient.

LIB = zlib-1.1.4

# 4. Is your zlib version 1.0.5 or older?
#
#    Some systems ship with quite old versions of zlib. If your system has zlib
#    1.0.5 or older, set the OLD_ZLIB variable to true.
#
#    Alternatively, you could upgrade to a newer version of zlib. See the
#    README file for details of where to get the zlib source.
#
#    Setting this variable to True will disable acces to the following zlib
#    functions
#
#        gzsetparams
#        gzeof


OLD_ZLIB = False
#OLD_ZLIB = True

# end of file config.in
