GPT 2.2 is now completely backwards compatible with GPT 1.x.  Bundles

versa.

GPT now includes the globus_core source package in its distribution.
This package is installed by gpt-build everytime a new build flavor is
requested.

gpt-deps is a new experimental script that generates an html page
which describes the various package dependencies within an
installation.  The script is considered experimental because changes
to the interface and output format are anticipated.

GPT now handles the *.sl shared lib extensions for HPUX.

gpt-build now has the -nosrc flag which tells it to just install a
build flavor.

Various fixes to the building of Compress::Zlib.

pages and usage messages.

gpt-install now has the functionality that used to be in gpt-update.
gpt-update is being depreciated.

gpt-bundle now has an alternative way to specify bundle names.  The
-bn flag can be used to input a name.  The -bv flag can be used to
input a version.  With this method gpt-bundle will add the bundle type
to the name as well as the architecture for binary bundles.

gpt-bundle now has the -nosetups flag which excludes any dependent
setup packages from the bundle.  Note that setup packages listed on
the command line will still be bundled.

gpt-bundle now has the -exclude flag which can be used to exclude
dependent packages from a bundle

package that is built. The -log flag has been replaced with the
-logdir flag which is used to enable logging and optionally specify
the path to the logging directory.

Various improvements in gpt-build log messages.

GPT now uses POD::Usage for script help.  The module is included in
the distribution.

New script gpt-translate-interpreter-pl can be used after a binary
package of GPT is installed to fix the shebang lines of the scripts to

library filename mangling.  To disable add the following to the
With_Flavor element:

<With_Flavor build="yes" ColocateLibraries="no">

The GPT source distribution was restructured.  The package_management
directory no longer exists and all GPM modules are now under
GPT::PkgMngmt.  FilelistFunctions is now under GPT.

Missing rtl packages now are reported correctly.

2.1 -> 2.1.1

A new script ./tools/make_rpm will create a binary RPM of GPT.  No
postinstall scripts yet.

gpt-update now properly updates rpm bundles.

will be replaced if the new version is >= the old version.

externally by the globus_openssl package.

gpt-build now has a -update flag which will overwrite source packages
if what's installed is an older version.

gpt-build now has a -disable-version-checking flag which can be used
to build packages with versioning problems in their dependencies.
These kinds of packages were released with GPT 1.X which did not
perform this check. NOTE that this flag will be set permanently for
the $GLOBUS_LOCATION being installed into.

gpt-update now will only replace packages which have the same
name-flavor-type but different version numbers.

gpt-update now has a -loose flag which allows pgm/pgm_static packages
to replace packages with the same name but different flavors.

4.0.4 is found.

gpt-install now changes file ownership to root if root is installing.

rpm.

gpt-install now can install a set of packages.

gpt-uninstall and gpt-install now accept multiple packages and/or
bundles as arguments.

with wild cards.  Unfortunately the flavor field is buggy.

uninstalled.

gpt-query now does file lookups and prints out package dependencies.

gpt-bundle now grabs packages which are runtime dependencies to setup
packages.


1.0 -> 2.0

dependency checking throughout GPT now checks the package
versions. The dependency module API was also redone.

globus-build was split into gpt-build and gpt-pkg.  gpt-build builds
packages.  gpt-pkg archives packages.

gpt-build now does dependency checking during builds.

gpt-build's -log flag was fixed.

gpt-build now removes empty packages after building.

gpt-build copies the files of pgm/pgm_static packages into flavored
subdirectories.

gpt-postinstall now runs all setup scripts.

gpt-query and gpt-install have a new command line interface which uses
the pkgname-flavor-pkgtype tuple. It's buggy though.

gpt-pkg now builds rpm's in addition to gpt packages.

gpt-bundle now bundles rpm's.

gpt-install now installs rpm's and rpm bundles.
